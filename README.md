# TENADRE-MENTEES-AI-TEAM
This project was worked on by a team of three mentees of TENADRE mentees. It is to predict the biodiesel yield given a set of input parameters- temperature, pressure, reaction time and methanol/oil ratio.The motivation behind this project was to get some more practical understanding of machine learning and artificial neural networks.MATLAB and PYTHON were used with main focus on Extreme Learning Machine(ELM) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithms.Other algorithms were also tested to create an efficient model.Stanley Eshiemogie,Shedrach Igemhokhai and Favour Ugbodu worked on this project together.
